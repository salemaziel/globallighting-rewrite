            <div className="blurb">
              <p>
                The <strong>Global Lighting Project</strong> is a 501c3
                non-profit that is on a mission to ensure all people have access
                to light, electricity, clean water, and sanitary cooking
                facilities using cutting edge LED light technology.
              </p>
              <p>
                Originally founded in 2016 in San Diego, California, the Global
                Lighting Project team first set out to bring energy and light to
                impoverished communities in India, where many live daily without
                access to light or electricity.
                <br></br>
                The team at Global Lighting Project researches, builds or
                purchases, and transports this LED technology to local
                organizations working in the communities we seek to benefit. We
                act as a supplier, distributor and educator for these local
                groups, donating LED light kits and educating them on how the
                technology works, so that they, in turn, can bring that
                knowledge and technology to their communities to share and teach
                others.
