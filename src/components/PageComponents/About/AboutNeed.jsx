        <p>
          Over 1.6 Billion people live without reliable access to electricity,
          clean water, sanitary cooking facilities, or the resources necessary
          to grow food.
</p>
<p>
          The Global Lighting Project is on a mission to change that.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ color: "#ffc529" }}>Our Vision:</h3>
        <p>
          We envision a world where renewable energy is accessible by all
          people to use at their discretion for the betterment of their
          communities.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ color: "#ffc529" }}>Our Mission:</h3>
        <p>
          Our mission is to change the future for impoverished people around
          the world by supplying the power of renewable energy, revolutionary
          LED light solutions, and educational workshops that will sustain
          their communities for generations to come.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ color: "#ffc529" }}>What We Do:</h3>
        <p>
          Our goal is to ensure all people have access to light, electricity,
          clean water, and sanitary cooking facilities by using cutting edge
          LED light technology. This includes white LEDs for energy-efficient
          lighting, RGB LEDs for growing food, and UV LEDs for
          sanitization/disinfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          By providing the technology and workshops on how to use the
          technology, we hope to make low-income, impoverished communities
          safer, healthier, and more sustainable.
