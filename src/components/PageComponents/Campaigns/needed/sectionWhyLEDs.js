                <p>
              LED lights offer a quick and highly energy efficient method of
              delivering ultraviolet rays compared to traditional mercury UV
              lamps. In addition, they turn on instantaneously, contain no
              mercury, and require only{" "}
              <strong>
                5-10% of the energy required by traditional UV lamps.{" "}

                    What Exactly Are LEDs?
                </h3>
                <p>
                LEDs, or Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are semiconductors consisting of a  stable structure or substrate, such as silicon or sapphire, covered (or doped) in precise materials, which are alternatively missing or supplying electrons from their outer shell. 
                As a voltage is applied, the  free electrons flowing  through the circuit  “fall” into the microscopic holes – or spaces in the electron ring – due to impurities in the doped substrate. By falling into a lower energy state, they release their excess energy in the form of light.</p>
                {/*The wavelength or color released can depend on the bandgap, or drop in energy, between the materials.
                </p>*/}
